SmartFarmingAdvisor

Overview
SmartFarmingAdvisor is an innovative machine learning project designed to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops for their specific environmental and soil conditions. By analyzing key parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels, Humidity, Temperature, pH, and Rainfall, the system provides tailored crop recommendations to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Features
Data-Driven Recommendations: Utilizes a detailed dataset to assess the best crop options.
Machine Learning Model: Implements classification algorithms to predict the most suitable crops.
User Input: Farmers can input their field conditions to get precise crop suggestions.
Web Interface: A simple and interactive web platform for easy access to recommendations.
Dataset
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing environmental and soil condition parameters crucial for crop growth. The dataset includes:

Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Humidity
Temperature
pH level
Rainfall
Machine Learning Model
The classification model is built using:

Python: The primary programming language.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-Learn: To train and evaluate the classification model.
Web Application
The web application is developed using:

Flask: A micro web framework for Python to handle user inputs and display recommendations.
Bootstrap & CSS: For creating a responsive and attractive user interface.
